# NETFLEX-clone

A responsive Netflix-style web app that showcases movies and TV shows with a clean, familiar UI. This project is a front-end clone built to practice modern web development skills — fetching data from an API, rendering media grids, implementing a featured hero area, and building responsive layouts.

## Features

- Home page with a featured banner and multiple media rows (e.g., Trending, Top Rated, Action).
- Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- Search and simple navigation (if implemented).
- Smooth hover effects and modal/detail views for individual items (if implemented).
- Uses an external movie database API (e.g., TMDB) to populate content.

## Built with

- HTML5 & CSS3 (or a CSS framework if used)
- JavaScript (or TypeScript)
- React (if applicable) — adjust to match the actual stack used in this repo
- Axios / fetch for API calls
- Optional: React Router, Redux / Context API for state, CSS Modules / Styled Components / SASS
